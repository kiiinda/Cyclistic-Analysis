I analyzed a dataset from Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company using R and created an interactive dashboard showing how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.  

### Background  
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. It offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. 
It was launched in 2016, has grown to a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles, and has locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime  

Cyclistic’s marketing strategy tried to build general awareness and appeal to broad consumer segments. It has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
annual memberships. Those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while those who purchase single annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

__Role__
In this scenario, I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic and my team has been tasked with the overall goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members


__Business Question:__ "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
