# Capstone Project

I analyzed a dataset from Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company using R, and created an interactive dashboard showing how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.  

### Background  
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share program with more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. It offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. 
It was launched in 2016, has grown to a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles, and has locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime  

Cyclistic’s marketing strategy tried to build general awareness and appeal to broad consumer segments. It has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
annual memberships. Those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are called casual riders while those who buy single annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

__Role__
In this scenario, I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic and my team has been tasked with the overall goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members


__Business Question:__ "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"


### Dashboard

#### Insights
1. Members had the most rides at __64%__ of the total. The average ride length is 16 minutes with casual riders having the longest average time of 23 minutes while members have 12 minutes.
2. The most popular bikes were __classic bikes__ for both but casual riders alone used docked bikes.
3. Members mostly used bikes equally throughout weekdays, with an increase on Wednesday and Thursday while casual riders mostly during weekends with an increase from Wednesday to Sunday and less on Mondays.
4. The busiest time when riders rode was in the __afternoon__. Riding time rose from 6 AM to 5 PM then started dropping from 6 PM. Nighttime, 3 AM least busy
5. __Summer (June to August)__ was busiest for both riders, more so during August. They rode less during __Winter__, especially during January.


#### Summary
1. Most riders by user type were members
2. Average ride length was 23 minutes, with casual members riding 11 more minutes than members
3. The most popular bike among riders was the classic bike.
4. Afternoon was the busiest time with 5 PM being the peak for both riders.
5. Saturday was the busiest day of the week, casual riders mostly use bikes on weekends
6. Summer was the busiest season



#### Suggestions
It was difficult to figure out since I have never been in this kind of scenario yet but this is what I would have suggested to convert casual users to members
- To personalize discounts depending on preference as well as during Summer which was the busiest time of year.
- Encourage new users to join by having members share their experiences of how Cyclistic has been for them to create a sense of community.


#### What I learned
- Using R for cleaning and analysis
- Creating visualizations in Power BI, using different visualizations as well as adding slicers to filter data



### I welcome any feedback to improve the project
